Suppose i have a tuple => 
t = (1,2)
can i change it NO!
BUT IF
t ={[1,2],[1,2,3]}
can i change the list inside the tuple => YES!

Then what do you actually mean by immutable?
I actually meant by that you cannot change the addesses of data inside tuple.
Here as the memory addess in the tuple is same for both list, the tuple is thinking it is still unchanged.

Q. Can You change values of tup = ([1,2],[1,2,3,4]) ? If yes why what do you mean by immutability of the tuple.
