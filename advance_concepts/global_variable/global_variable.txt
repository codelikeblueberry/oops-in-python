local variables are those variables which are having scope only inside the function:
gloabal variables that are declared outside the function and having scope to all functions and nested function.
If you declared the global variable before calling it then it will not throw error.

q. write a function that return a function which sum all the given parameters of integers.
i=0
def function():   
    def sum_func():
        global i
        for j in range(10):
            i = i+j
        return i
    return function

func = function() # returns a sum_function which is assigned to func
func() # calling func variable
        
# work of global keyword 
# 1. Resist to make the global assigned varibale in the scope instead it tells that please global
# globally and take that variable
